Experimenting with 2D game development in Java without any libraries, ignore the graphics :)

[Video Demo](https://github.com/k0dev/FirstGame/assets/108899333/0076539b-9220-4332-b372-f8668b9bc9b2)

Currently the game is a simple tower defense. Click on the weapons (white squares) to toggle them. The bullets are limited and can be bought in the shop. Weapon upgrades are avaiable in the shop also.
